## Introduction

## Atomic Design

Atomic design is methodology helping to design and develop a `pattern system`.

This methodology have been define by [Brad Frost](http://bradfrost.com/) as so:

> Atomic Design details all that goes into creating and maintaining robust design systems, allowing you to roll out higher quality, more consistent UIs faster than ever before. This book introduces a methodology for thinking of our UIs as thoughtful hierarchies, discusses the qualities of effective pattern libraries, and showcases techniques to transform your team's design and development workflow.

Example:

> `Atoms` are UI elements that can’t be broken down any further and serve as the elemental building blocks of an interface.

> `Molecules` are collections of atoms that form relatively simple UI components.

> `Organisms` are relatively complex components that form discrete sections of an interface.

> `Templates` place components within a layout and demonstrate the design’s underlying content structure.

> `Pages` apply real content to templates and articulate variations to demonstrate the final UI and test the resilience of the design system.
